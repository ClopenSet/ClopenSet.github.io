        <h2>My NandProject</h2>
        <p>I provide a JSON formatted game save which has cleared (Actually, I haven't cleared yet) all levels of Nandgame. This game is genuinely fun, easy to start, and highly practical, progressing from simple to complex. It serves as an excellent learning tool to systematically understand fundamental computer technology through a hands-on approach. Please visit <a href="https://nandgame.com/">their game page (https://nandgame.com)</a> to support them.</p>
        <p>I have translated these graphical connections into equivalent Verilog code, enhancing the exploration of computer hardware through simulation and code analysis, making it more convenient and in-depth.</p>
        <p>The complete Verilog code and game save for all hardware components are available. The software and optional challenge components are currently under development.</p>
        <p>Run the code in your terminal below to clone the project to your computer:</p>
        <p><code>git clone https://github.com/ClopenSet/NandgameProject.git</code></p>
